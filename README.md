# Country API Website Form

This project is a simple website form that utilizes a country API to fetch country information and allows users to save selected data to local storage.

## Features

1. **Country Information Display**: Users can input a country name or select from a dropdown list to fetch information such as capital, population, currency, etc., using a country API.

2. **Local Storage Save Data**: Selected country information (e.g., capital, population) can be saved to the browser's local storage. This allows users to revisit the website and view previously saved data without needing to fetch it again from the API.

3. **Form Submission**: The website includes a form where users can input a country name or select from a dropdown list and submit the form to fetch and display country information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arinahuque23/Country-API.git
